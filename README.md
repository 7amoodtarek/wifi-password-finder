# wifi-password-finder
Use this code in your school/uni computer lab to find (hack) your targeted WI-FI router in the room to get it's password. You can also use this in your device at home to find the password of your own Wi-fi network incase you forgot it.

This is currently available only for windows, still working for macos and linux.
